## GPIO Pins.

The input and output pins play crucial roles in the functionality of the circuit, contributing to its operation . Below is the function assignment for each of the pins:

Input Pins: 

- Data_in : 8-bit vecto.

Output Pins: 

- Data_out: 3-bit vector where the encoding is shown.
- Valid: This pin indicates if the data shown in the output is valid.
